About Dataset
⭐ Dataset Description
🫀 This dataset contains clinical and lifestyle information used to assess the risk of heart disease in individuals.
Each row represents a patient, and each column captures a medical attribute that may influence cardiovascular health. The dataset is widely used for 🧠 classification tasks, 📊 EDA, and 🤖 machine learning models aimed at predicting heart disease.

The features include demographic details, vital signs, cholesterol levels, ECG readings, exercise-related symptoms, and other health indicators. These variables help identify patterns and support early diagnosis through data-driven insights.

This dataset is suitable for:

🤖 Binary classification models
